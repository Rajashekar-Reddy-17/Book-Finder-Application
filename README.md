# üìö Java Book Search Tool

A simple command-line application built with Java that interacts with the **Open Library API** to search for books by title/author, look up books by ISBN, and save favorite titles to a local reading list.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Search by Title/Author:** Fetches book metadata (title, author, publication year, cover ID) from the Open Library Search API.
  * **Search by Identifier (ISBN):** Allows precise lookup of a single book using its ISBN-10 or ISBN-13.
  * **Local Reading List:** Save selected search results to a list that persists while the application is running (in memory).
  * **Book Cover URL Generation:** Generates a direct URL for fetching the book's cover image.

  * **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
  * **Build Tool:** Maven
  * **API Client:** `java.net.http.HttpClient` (Standard library)
  * **JSON Processing:** **Gson** (from Google) for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
  * **External API:** [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
